# Phone Catalog: my first project!

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Phone Catalog**, my **semester 1 of C project** where i got into web scraping work! This project showcases my ability to extract, clean, and manage large datasets, providing a valuable resource for anyone interested in mobile phone specifications.

## What is it?

This program is designed to manage and make sense of a vast collection of mobile phone data. It's built as a comprehensive reference tool, allowing users to explore and leverage the insights derived from a massive dataset.

## Data Source & Acquisition

I've **scraped data from [phonedb.net](https://phonedb.net)** using a dedicated "web-scrapper" extension, you can look up to web extension store on browser. This process allowed me to gather a huge and extensive dataset of phone information.

### Important Note on Data Usage:

The data collected and processed in this Phone Catalog project is strictly for **personal, non-commercial use** and serves as a demonstration of web scraping, data handling, and project management skills. It is intended for educational and reference purposes only.

## Data Quality

The raw scraped data has been processed and refined into a **"clean version"**, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and usability. This clean dataset is ready for analysis and integration into various applications.

## Get Involved!
